    "# **Abstraction**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), abstraction is the concept of hiding the internal details of an object and exposing only the necessary information. It allows you to work with higher-level concepts without getting bogged down by the details of how something works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a car:\n",
    "\n",
    "You know that you need to press the accelerator to move faster, but you don’t need to know how the engine works to achieve that. That’s abstraction — you only need to know what to do, not how it happens.\n",
    "In Python, abstraction is typically achieved through abstract classes and abstract methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### *When to Use Abstraction?*\n",
    "\n",
    "When you need to define a common interface for multiple related objects (like defining how all types of shapes must have a method to calculate their area).\n",
    "\n",
    "When you want to hide complexity from users and provide them with a simplified way to interact with objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you want to enforce that certain methods should be implemented by all subclasses, but you don’t want to provide a specific implementation in the base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Abstract Classes**\n",
    "\n",
    "An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated directly. It serves as a blueprint for other classes. Abstract classes may contain abstract methods that must be implemented by any subclass that inherits from the abstract class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, abstract classes are defined using the abc module (Abstract Base Classes).\n",
    "\n",
    "### *Why Use Abstract Classes?*\n",
    " If you want to ensure that all subclasses implement certain methods, you can define those methods as abstract in the base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "To provide partial implementation: You can define common methods in the abstract class and leave specific details to the subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### *How to Create an Abstract Class?*\n",
    "Import ABC (Abstract Base Class) from the abc module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inherit from ABC in your base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the @abstractmethod decorator to mark methods that must be implemented by subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Abstract Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "An abstract method is a method that is declared but contains no implementation. Subclasses of an abstract class must provide an implementation for the abstract methods. Abstract methods are defined using the @abstractmethod decorator.\n",
    "\n",
    "### *When to Use Abstract Methods*\n",
    "When you want to force subclasses to implement a particular method.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you need to define methods in the base class that have no meaningful default behavior, and it’s up to the subclasses to define them.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Example of Abstraction, Abstract Classes, and Abstract Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a simple example that shows how to use abstraction, abstract classes, and abstract methods in Python."
