    "OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects,\". The four main principles of OOP are:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Encapsulation**: Bundling data and methods that operate on the data within a class and restricting access to some of the object's components.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Abstraction**: Hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inheritance**: Allowing a new class to inherit properties and methods from an existing class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Polymorphism:** Allowing objects of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through shared methods.\n",

    "| **Data and Functions**    | Data and functions are separate | Data and functions are bundled in objects |\n",
    "| **Code Reusability**      | Limited code reusability      | High reusability through classes and inheritance |\n",
    "| **Encapsulation**         | No encapsulation, data is exposed | Data is encapsulated and protected   |\n",
    "| **Complexity Management** | Harder to manage as programs grow | Easier to manage large programs with classes |\n",
    "| **Code Duplication**      | Often leads to code duplication | Reduces code duplication through inheritance and polymorphism |\n",
