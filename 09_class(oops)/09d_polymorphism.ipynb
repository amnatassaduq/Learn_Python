    "\n",
    "In Python, you can define a method (like sound()) in multiple classes (e.g., Dog, Cat), and even though the method has the same name, each class can have its own version of that method.\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes your code shorter and more flexible because the same function can work with many types of objects."

    "\n",
    "* Both Dog and Cat have the same method name, sound(), but the implementation is different for each. The make_sound() function works for both animals without needing to know exactly what kind of animal it’s dealing with."

    "*Why This is Useful:*\n",
    "\n",
    "* Instead of writing separate functions like make_dog_sound() and make_cat_sound(), we just have one function, make_sound(), that works for any animal as long as it has a sound() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This makes the code more flexible and easy to expand. If you add more animals (e.g., a Cow class), you don’t need to change make_sound()—you just make sure the new class has a sound() method."
